## v3.1.2

Changes

  - Gem is available via [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org)

## v3.1.1

Bugfixes

  - Updated deletion constraints such that lucene special characters in
    dataset names do not cause deletion of that data provider's data to fail.

## v3.1.0

Features

  - Remove gi-cat as a dependency as no harvesters utilize it.
  - Harvest the UCAR NCAR - Earth Observing Laboratory (UCAR/NCAR EOL) from
    EOL's THREDDS endpoint instead of GI-Cat
  - Harvest the Norwegian Meteorological Institute feed directly instead of via
    GI-Cat.

Bugfixes

  - Fix broken configuration, where production was attempting to use the Blue,
    rather than the the production, Solr host for harvesting. (see PCT-410)

## v3.0.1

Bugfixes

  - Fix broken `delete_all` commands.

## v3.0.0

  - Packaged as a gem with a new executable file, providing a new interface to
    harvest feeds into solr.
  - Change the RDA and EOL harvesters to store the data center name as "UCAR
    NCAR", rather than "UCAR/NCAR". This fixes a bug with deleting the datasets;
    the query to Solr was failing because the "/" character could not be
    correctly escaped.
